# report.json field guide

Written by `scripts/audit.py scan` to `<root>/.repo-xray/report.json`.

## scan

- `root` — absolute path that was analyzed.
- `files_scanned` — counts by group (`python`, `js`, `all_text`). The
  `js` group covers js/mjs/cjs/jsx/ts/tsx/mts/cts (`.d.ts` files are
  reference text only — no symbols extracted from them). `all_text`
  additionally includes html/json/yml/toml, which count as reference
  sources (a function used only in an HTML `onclick` still shows a
  reference). `.md`/`.css` are scanned but count as DOC files — mentions
  there never rescue a dead candidate.
- `excluded_dirs` — directories never entered (node_modules, venv, …).
  Minified files (`*.min.js`) and files over 2 MB are also skipped.
- `note` — the standing caveat about name-based counting. Repeat its
  substance whenever you recommend deletion.
- `near_duplicate_scan_truncated` — true when the near-duplicate pass
  hit its comparison cap; say the near-dup list may be incomplete.

## dead_candidates

Symbols whose name appears nowhere in code files outside their own
definitions. Decorated ones are moved out into `decorated_unreferenced`.

- `kind` — `function` | `class` | `js-function` | `js-class` | `ts-type`.
  Python methods are deliberately excluded (instance calls make name
  counting too noisy); JS/TS class methods are not extracted at all
  (regex scanner).
- `refs_found` / `appears_in` — reference count in code files outside
  definitions, and which code files mention the name at all.
- `doc_mentions` — `.md`/`.css` files that mention the name. These do
  NOT count as references; if the code is deleted, these docs must be
  fixed in the same turn.
- `looks_wip` (Python only) — `true` when the symbol looks unfinished
  (pass-only / `...` / `raise NotImplementedError` / empty body / a
  TODO·FIXME·WIP·XXX comment in its scope). Zero references then likely
  means "not wired up yet", not "dead". NEVER recommend deleting a
  `looks_wip` symbol — ask if it's still under development (FP-07). JS/TS
  symbols don't carry this flag (regex scanner has no body).
- Names starting with `_` and `main` are skipped by design, and so is
  everything in test files (`test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, `conftest.py`,
  `*.test.ts` …) — unittest/pytest/jest invoke those by naming
  convention, not by reference.

Known false-positive sources: `getattr`/string dispatch, template
strings, config-driven wiring, names used only in files outside the
scanned extensions.

## decorated_unreferenced

Same shape as `dead_candidates`, but every entry has decorators
(routes, hooks, event handlers). Frameworks call these by registration,
not by name — treat as "probably alive" and never recommend deletion.
Only worth mentioning if the user asks for an exhaustive audit.

## duplicate_functions

Groups of Python functions with identical logic after normalization
(function name, decorators, docstring, and local variable names all
ignored; bodies shorter than 4 lines skipped). High confidence —
present these as genuine duplicates. `length` is the line count of
each copy.

## near_duplicate_functions

Pairs of Python functions whose normalized ASTs are ≥ 0.9 similar but
not identical (bodies shorter than 6 lines skipped, top 20 by
similarity). This catches the "re-implemented it 90% the same" AI
failure that exact matching misses. Weaker evidence than
`duplicate_functions`: always read both before recommending a merge,
and present as suspicion, not verdict. Python only — the JS/TS side
has no AST. Pairs inside test files are usually benign (similar test
bodies are normal); mention them last, if at all.

## js_name_collisions

The same function name defined in two or more different JS files. Not
necessarily a bug (modules scope names), but in browser-global vanilla
JS the later `<script>` silently wins — worth flagging when both files
are loaded by the same HTML page.

## oversized_files / oversized_functions

Python/JS files over 400 lines (top 15) and Python functions/methods
over 60 lines (top 15). Size alone is not a defect; use as "where to
look first" guidance, not as a verdict.

## python_parse_errors

Files the AST parser could not read. Their symbols are missing from
every other section — mention this if the user asks about code in one
of these files.

## find output (stdout JSON)

- `exact_hits` — word-boundary matches, `file`/`line`/`text`, capped at
  80. At the cap, say "80개 이상" rather than an exact count.
- `similar_symbol_names` — fuzzy matches against every defined symbol
  name; check before declaring something doesn't exist.
- `scan_range.files_scanned` — quote this number in absence answers.
